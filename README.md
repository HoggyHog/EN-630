## Steps

Run main.py which reads in the values entry by entry from file `630-datafile.csv`. Then it follows the `Liu & Jordan model` to calculate the value of IT, which is then added in as a new column, and finally saved to `tilted_radiation.csv`

## Further steps

Can prompt the user to give inputs such as
- Latitude
- Longitude
- beta
- Gamma
- rho (ground reflectance)
